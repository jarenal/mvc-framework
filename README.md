# Welcome!

This is a test project using a basic MVC Framework and implementing a basic Dependencies Injection Container, both created from scratch.

## Setup

Clone or download the project in a folder and then install dependencies using composer:

```bash
    $ cd PROJECT_FOLDER
    $ composer install
```

Start Docker containers using

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Then open in your browser the next url:

http://localhost:8080

NOTICE: The database is automatically imported when you are using Docker, but if you need to import the database manually you will find the dump at ./tools/schema/dump.sql
